# Jquery.disable

Disable any element with a jQuery.

## Usage

```javascript

$('#element').disable();
$('#element').enable();
```

## Details

Standard HTML only lets you disable a few input elements. This plugin lets you specify any element for mor dynamic UIS and disable user interaction to it.
The plugins `disable` method creates a transparent div and does some positioning magic to put it over the element you have targeted. This blocks click interaction to the element.
